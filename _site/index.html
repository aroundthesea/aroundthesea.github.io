      <h3 id="omada-health">Omada Health</h3>
<p>I primarily work on the billing engine and develop features for the revenue cycle management team. My work is largely backend, with some frontend for our internal application. The stack I work with is Ruby, Rails, and ReactJS.</p>

<p>A recent project I led was building out the concept of work queues. A pain point for our internal stakeholders was the manual checks they had to perform before and after running billing each month, which caused a delay in actions they could take.</p>

<p>What we did was automate their manual checks in our system by putting together and optimizing queries they would conduct across different data sets, and then built out a UI using React for them to be able to take action real-time.</p>

<p>My work at Omada is sensitive, to abide by Protected Health Information (PHI) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules. But if you’re curious, please do reach out!</p>

<h3 id="lumos-labs">Lumos Labs</h3>
<p>I primarily worked on landing pages (with marketing &amp; design teams) and developed new features for the user dashboard (with product, design &amp; data science teams). The stack I worked with was Ruby, Rails, and ReactJS.</p>

<p>One of the landing pages I worked on with marketing was the login page. We would conditionally display a set of banners alongside the login form, based on user information &amp; percentages entered by marketing via <a href="https://www.braze.com/">Braze</a>.</p>

<p>One of the frontend projects I worked on was adding in visualizations and animations (using <a href="https://airbnb.design/lottie/">Lottie</a>) for a player’s game progress report. We ranked by the number of times a game was played and visually displayed how much a player improved (or not!) via a React graphing library.</p>

<h3 id="wepay">WePay</h3>

<p>I primarily worked on the API, helping develop a <a href="https://developer.wepay.com/api/implementation/mfa">Multi-Factor Authentication API</a>, and eventually shifted towards starting frontend development at the company. As an API-first company then, there was not much UI/UX or design for our products, so it was the first foray into thinking about what the company could offer and what we could build for our customers.</p>

<p>One of the frontend projects I worked on was a whitelabel solution, which has since evolved into <a href="https://go.wepay.com/clear/">Clear</a>.</p>

<p>The stack I worked in was PHP &amp; Kohana, Python &amp; Flask, and AngularJS.</p>
